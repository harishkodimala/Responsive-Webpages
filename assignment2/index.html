                You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. 
                Don't worry kiddo, where there's a demand, there will be a supply; 
                we'll all have our roads.

                If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, 
                demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage 
                of your income, is that taxation?

                Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can 
                protect their property with fully automatic weapons.
